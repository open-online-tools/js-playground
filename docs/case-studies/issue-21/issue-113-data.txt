Make sure we update all other places with paths to support ./js folder for js.yml

Please download all logs and data related about the issue to this repository, make sure we compile that data to `./docs/case-studies/issue-{id}` folder, and use it to do deep case study analysis (also make sure to search online for additional facts and data), in which we will reconstruct timeline/sequence of events, find root causes of the problem, and propose possible solutions.
